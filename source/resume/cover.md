Dear Sirs,

I am interested in the F# Development position I recently learned
about through James Woods of Kaizen Partnership. 

I have been using F# non-professionally for about 2 1/2 years. Since
then I have learned other functional programming languages, developed
sample programs, and given several presentations at user groups and
Code Camps including:

* __"F# For Real Applications"__ at Boise Code Camp 
  where we talked about building WPF, Silverlight, and ASP.NET MVC 
  applications using F# as a general purpose programming language
* Various sessions at the Seattle ALT.NET monthly meetings.

I've read all the published F# books, the almost-published "Functional
Programming for the Real World," and started a book club late last
year around "F# For Scientists." 

Finally, I've been to several workshops on functional programming and
F# specifically, such as the F# session Matthew Podwysocki did at
Kaizen Conf in Austin last year.

I have 5 years experience in Financial Services, primarily building
applications for portfolio management, replication, analytics, and 
am currently studying for the CFA Level I.

Thanks for considering me for this position and I look forward to the
chance to work with you.
